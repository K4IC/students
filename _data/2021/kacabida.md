# About me
>  A man living on the edge of time itself, he hails from the chaotic lands of Roxas City, Capiz. See him speedrunning and clashing through different wars at the last minute. Having pressure always lurking by his side through battles and whose punctuality is rarely found he enters the battleground. Conquering deadlines, delivering satisfaction and withstanding sleep he fights until the last second.
